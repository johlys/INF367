    "- Around 13000 datapoints in total, split into ~8700 training and ~4300.\n",
    "- 13 original features including PassengerId. Descriptions from Kaggle.\n",
    "    - **PassengerId** - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.\n",
    "    - **HomePlanet** - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.\n",
    "    - **CryoSleep** - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.\n",
    "    - **Cabin** - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.\n",
    "    - **Destination** - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.\n",
    "    - **Age** - The age of the passenger.\n",
    "    - **VIP** - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.\n",
    "    - **RoomService**, **FoodCourt**, **ShoppingMall**, **Spa**, **VRDeck** - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.\n",
    "    - **Name** - The first and last names of the passenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- And the prediction target:\n",
    "    - **Transported** - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict."
